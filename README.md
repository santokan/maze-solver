# MAZE SOLVER 5000

## boot.dev guided project

This one is to practice deep first search algorithm.
The goal is to find the shortest path from the start to the end of the maze.

## Ideas for the future

- make it a game where user chooses directions
- add configuration in the GUI (maze size, speed, etc..)
